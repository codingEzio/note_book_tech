Adding authentication

    the end result should be like this (roughly)
        0)    each drone has an owner
        1)    read/write to the owner of the drone
        2)    read only  to anyone except the owner | or users that havn't logged-in
        misc) whenever a drone is created, it'll be attached to the request user :)

    global conf
        'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
            'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication',
            'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',
        ],

    adding customized permission class (drones/custompermission.py)
        class ClassName(..BasePermission):
            ~ safe methods -> whatever              (R)
            ~ not safe one -> check your identity   (R) (R/W)
            def has_object_permission(..):
                if SAFE:
                    return True
                else:
                    return obj.owner == request.user

    attaching "Users" to the "Drones"
        ~ drones/models.py
            owner = ..ForeignKey('auth.User', ..='drones', ..=..CASCADE)

        ~ drones/serializers.py
            class DroneCategorySerializer():
                # just add an 'owner.username' read-only field

            class UserDroneSerializer():
                # Drone => url, name

            class UserSerializer():
                # User  => url, pk, username, drone (plus an `UserDroneSerializer`)

        ~ drones/views.py
            class DroneList(UNCHANGED):
                ...
                ...
                def perform_update(..):
                    .. save(owner=self.request.user)

    setting permission policies
        drones/views.py > DroneList & DroneDetail
        [IMPORT]
            from rest_framework import permissions
            from drones         import custompermission
        [APPEND]
            permission_classes = (permissions.IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly,
                                  custompermission.IsCurrentUserOwnerOrReadOnly)

    -------------------------

    adding admins
    @ Django
        ./manage.py createsuperuser
    @ PostgresQL
        since we're just added the 'owner', we have to assign a default owner
        to make it possible to ADD this new field WITHOUT delete those drones.

        ./manage.py makemigrations drones
            _ SELECT a one-off default now  (a default value for newly added field)
            _ 1                             (default user for all 'owner' row)
        ./manage.py migrate

    adding browserable APIs
        PROJ/urls.py
            url(r'^api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls'))

    testing
        http                            DELETE :8000/drones/6
        http --auth "d":"YOUR_PASSWORD" DELETE :8000/drones/6

        you can either use `curl`, `httpie`
        or use Postman or Postman-like software like "Insomnia" (open source)

    STATUS
        basic authentication has been implemented (name plus password)

    -----------------------

Adding token-based authentication (along with the one we've created before)
    Getting new models
        # newly added tables (authtoken_token) store tokens & the fk to 'auth_user'
        PROJ/settings.py
            add 'rest_framework.authtoken' to 'INSTALLED_APPS'
        PROJ/
            run './manage.py migrate' (new models from the 'authtoken' app!)

    New perm|auth classes for views
        add this to `PilotList` & `PilotDetail` {
            authentication_classes = (TokenAuthentication,) << rest.. .authentication
            permission_classes     = (IsAuthenticated,)     << rest.. .permissions
        }

    Generate a token for authentication
        well, normally you should be able to do this
        you could also go '..:8000/admin/' to manually generate one

        but I can't (and him: https://stackoverflow.com/q/52129128/6273859) {
            from rest_framework.authtoken.models import Token
            from django.contrib.auth.models      import User

            u = User.objects.get(username='a')
            t = Token.objects.create(user=u)

            t.key
        }

    Okay now you should get the key, let's test
        http :8000/pilots/
        curl -iX GET localhost:8000/pilots/

        http :8000/pilots/ "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN"
        curl -iX GET localhost:8000/pilots/ -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN"
