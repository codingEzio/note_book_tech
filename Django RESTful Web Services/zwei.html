# Meta
- Models (concept)
    DroneCategory   cat-name
    Drone           cat-fk, name, manu-date, parti-or-not, inserted-timestamp
    Pilot           name, gender, how-many-races-parti, inserted-timestamp
    Competition     pilot-fk, drone-fk, distance-in-feet, date-drone-reached-timestamp
- Operations
    - GET       single
    - GET       list
    - POST      add
    - PUT       update
    - PATCH     update
    - DELETE    delete
    - OPTIONS   check what methods are supported

# Foreword
- Bascically the same conf as the previous project, but a bit more complex.
- Also, we added postgreSQL. Here's the steps
    1. Basics
        $ brew update && brew install postgresql
        $ createuser -dP djrestful
        $ createdb -E utf-8 -U djrestful drones
    2. Configuration
        'ENGINE'  : 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME'    : os.environ.get('POSTGRE_DRONE_DB_NAME'),
        'USER'    : os.environ.get('POSTGRE_DRONE_DB_USER'),
        'PASSWORD': os.environ.get('POSTGRE_DRONE_DB_PSWD'),
    3. Sync to DB, a few notes here
        since I was using sqlite before, you might be better run the initial
        updates first (the basic tables like '...content_types'), then run the
        new migrations (i.e. drones) (of course, do this AFTER you wrote those models)
    4. Checking (check if our database is correctly created)
        $           psql --username=djrestful --dbname=drones
        drones=>    \dt                             list tables
        drones=>    \d+ drones_drone                check column info
        drones=>    SELECT * FROM drones_drone;

HyperlinkedModelSerializer | ModelSerializer
- Use hyperlinks to indicate relationships instead of primary key (I think)

# Writing a bunch of serializers for different models
- what's in there
    `class Meta` controls what to display,
    stuff outside of `Meta`, they do stuff like creating relationships
- some hard parts
    - view_name specify what view'd be used when users clicks on it (browse related models)
    - SlugRelatedField "represents the target of the relationship"

# Writing views
    we're using another high level comparing to `APIView`, that is the generics.
    We got two of them: ListCreateAPIView, RetrieveUpdateDestropAPIView, oh! just
    remember, this kind of generics did almost all the stuff for us, the basic APIView
    implemented methods like `create` & `update`, and the generics (bulit by many Mixins),
    did the job like "what HTTP verbs are supported" kind of thing :)

    After you've written those views (**List and **Detail), add `ApiRoot`
    it basicall serves for the "routes" (list/ list/NUM)

# Writing routes
    One root routes,
        url(r'^$',
            views.ApiRoot.as_view(), name=views.ApiRoot.name),
    and the rest is pretty the same
        url(r'^drones/$',
            views.DroneList.as_view(), name=views.DroneList.name),
        url(r'^drones/(?P<pk>[0-9]+)$',
            views.DroneDetail.as_view(), name=views.DroneDetail.name),
    lastly,
        add     url(r'^', include('drones.urls')),  (do NOT add 'namespace=..')
        remove  'app_name' in 'drones/urls.py'

----- ----- ----- -----

# Adding constraints
    simply add a new 'unique=True' to current 'name' field (DroneCat.. Drone Pilot)
    then making migrations
        $ ./manage.py makemigrations drones
        $ ./manage.py migrate

    Testing
        ~ :8000/drone-categories/
        ~ :8000/pilots/

# Adding pagination feature
    Two ways doing it
        pages/4     4th page        maybe you have 3 items in page just saying)
        offset 4,5  from 4, get 5   a lot more freedom (advanced paging IMHO)

    Simply add this to achieve the basic pagination
        REST_FRAMEWORK = {
            'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS': 'rest_framework.pagination.LimitOffsetPagination',
            'PAGE_SIZE'               : 3
        }

        Adding an upper bound to limit the items in one page
        1. Add 'drones/custompagination.py'
        2. Then override `LimitOffsetPagination` with `max_limit = 8`
        3. Replace the default with 'drones.custompagination.YOUR_CLASS_NAME'

        Then you can test it (whether it's browser or httpie)
        $ http GET ":8000/drones/"
        $ http GET ":8000/drones/?limit=1"
        $ http GET ":8000/drones/?offset=2"
        $ http GET ":8000/drones/?limit=3&offset=3"


# Adding features like filtering|searching|sorting
    New package needed (why 1.0.4? it's (100%) compatible with current djREST(3.6.4))
        https://pypi.org/project/django-filter/1.0.4/

        remember adding it to 'INSTALLED_APPS' ('django_filters',)
        and adding the configurations ('DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS': (.. .. ..))

        There are the classes would be used
        * rest_framework.filters.SearchFilter
        * rest_framework.filters.OrderingFilter
        * django_filters.rest_framework.filters.FilterSet
        * django_filters.rest_framework.DjangoFilterBackend

    Adding stuff to our view functions
        Add these {
            * filter_fields     powered by djfilter (~.rest_...DjangoFilterBackend)
            * search_fields     powered by djrest   (~.filters.OrderingFilter)
            * ordering_fields   powered by djrest   (~.filters.SearchFilter)
        }

        add three fields above to {
            DroneCategoryList       filter/order by 'name', search 'name' (O => O..)
            DroneCategoryDetail     filter/order by 'name', search 'name' (O => O..)
            DroneList               f|o|s   ->  name/cat/manu-date/has-it-completed
            PilotList               f|o|s   ->  name/gender/races_count
            CompetitionList         f(customized) o(dist-feet,dist-date) s(nope)
        }

Notes on "Adding features like filtering|searching|sorting"

    For those props who contains the same fields (aka. 'name')
    > filter_fields     must be fullname (it's not searching)
    > search_fields     depends on how you write it (^ OR = OR @ OR $)

    About the props in view class
    > filter_fields     it's a shortcut actually (just like the 'CompetitionFilter')
    > search_fields     it actually based the built-in admin functionality (?S=XXX)
    > ordering_fields   (based on serializer_class OR '__all__') or you control it

    https://django-filter.readthedocs.io/en/1.1.0/ref/filters.html
    > About the 'CompetitionFilter' (<= djfilter.FilterSet)
        ~ first, we don't need the 'search' feature
        ~ second, this time we use the FULL (not shortcut) to named the filter fields
            + this time it's a class inherited from 'rest_.. .filters.FilterSet'
              and we're also using the filters provided by 'django-filter'
            + DateTimeFilter(
                  label='WHAT_U_SEE_ABOVE_THE_FILTER_FORM',         // 'ðŸ‘© Pilots'
                  name='THE_ACTUALY_FIELD_NAME_IN_THE_MODEL',       // 'drone__name'
                  lookup_expr='EXPRESSIONS_LIKE_EXACT_CONTAINS_GTE' // 'lte'
              )
        ~ third, as for the 'DateTimeFilter', 'NumberFilter' ...
            + a simple example
                - DateTimeFilter  <> models.DateTimeFilter
                - CharFilter      <> models.CharField, models.TextField
        ~ fourth, the `class Meta` is pretty straightforward
            + model     what models were related
            + fields    what fields should be displayed at the form
        ~ lastly, we add the 'filter_class' and the 'ordering_fields'
            + filter_class = CompetitionFilter (customized filter (>filter_fields))
            + ordering_fields (ordering by WHAT)

    https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/filtering/#searchfilter
    > Searching behavior
      ~ ^name         starts-with     Search 'O' => "Olive", "Oriana"
      ~ =username     exact matches   Search 'O' => \ (it has be full name)
      ~ @ (Full-text, mySQL only)
      ~ $ (Regex)


    Testing it {
        since Django REST framework also provided a browser UI
        you can test in there and then copy/check the generated URLs/Params
    }
