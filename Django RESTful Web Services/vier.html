# Throttling
- There is no limit whatsoever to anno/authed-user
- we wanna achieve something like 'N requests per hour MAX'
    ~  3 requests/hour FOR anno
    ~ 10 requests/hour FOR authed
    ~ 15 requests/hour FOR pilots-related views
    ~ 20 requests/hour FOR drones-related views

# Implementing the throttling mechanism
    adding stuff to PROJ/settings.py
        'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES'      : (
            'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',
            'rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle',
        ),
        'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES'        : {
            'anno'  : '3/hour',     # ..AnnoRateThrottle (scope = 'anno')
            'user'  : '5/hour',     # ..UserRateThrottle (scope = 'user')
            'drones': '20/hour',    # specify the 'scope' & 'class' by our own
            'pilots': '16/hour',    # if you do by ur own, the defaults won't affect you
        },

    adding stuff to 'drones/views.py'
        class DroneList|DroneDetail(..):
            throttle_scope = 'drones'
            throttle_classes = (ScopedRateThrottle, )
            ...

        class PilotList|PilotDetail(..):
            throttle_scope = 'pilots'
            throttle_classes = (ScopedRateThrottle, )
            ...

    testing
        for i in {1..4}; do http                        :8000/competitions/1; done;
        for i in {1..4}; do http -a "NAME":"PASSWD"     :8000/competitions/1; done;

        for i in {1..20}; do http                       :8000/drones/1; done;
        for i in {1..20}; do http -a "NAME":"PASSWD"    :8000/drones/1; done;

        // I can't auth on ':8000/pilots/', weird ...

Adding API versioning
    Foreword
        ~ "Creating a new version of your API should be a last resort."
        ~ "Your API re-design becomes the consumer’s problem."
        ~ "If possible, we'd always avoid any versioning scheme (adding complexities)"

    ~ https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/versioning/#api-reference
    There're different ways of doing this {
        AcceptHeaderVersioning      'application/json; version=x.y'
        HostNameVersioning          v2.WEBSITE.com/drones/
        URLPathVersioning           ../v2/restservices/drones/
        NamespaceVersioning [✔️]    same(to C) as URLPathVersioning (diff at backend)
        QueryParameterVersioning    WEBSITE.com/?version=2
    }

    Since the thing we're implementing is a simple API, so the "versioning"
    is quite simple here as well (only a little bit "customize" in the views.py)

    Let me list the files that need to be changed
    ~ PROJ/urls.py          routes for diff versions (& vN/api-auth for login/logout)
    ~ drones/v2/urls.py     normal routes (for us, the regex part is a bit different)
    ~ drones/v2/views.py    depend on your own (for us, we modified the "root" a little)


----------------------


Adding tests ★
    Get needed packages
        $ pipenv install pytest==3.5.1          # the versions are quite old
        $ pipenv install pytest-django==3.2.1   # mainly for compatability reasons

    ~ https://stackoverflow.com/a/54493489/6273859
    Most-used pytest commands
        $ pytest --collect-only     # find only without running
        $ pytest --capture=no       # if you wanna see your `print` messages
        $ pytest --verbose          #
        $ pytest -r fp              # a short summary (f: failed, p: passed)
        $ pytest PATH::CLASS:FUNC   # e.g. drones/tests.py::GreetingTest::test_ha

    Snippets
        self.client.credentials()   # clean up the credentials (if u need re-auth)


    Notice
        Since I'm just starting to touch on this topic, espically the
        "versioning APIs" part. I'll just choose the dummy way of doing it,
        add a prefix '/v1' to current 'reversed urls', not so smart but it's
        working right now (I know it'll be a bad practice if your APIs got
        more versions & more complex logic XD)

    Epilogue
        The part of the tests passes only if I run it separately,
        that's really odd..

THE END
